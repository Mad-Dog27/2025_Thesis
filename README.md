## Abstract
This thesis investigates real-time measurement of speech audibility in classroom environments using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation. The work focuses on the design, implementation, and validation of a privacy-preserving acoustic measurement system combining embedded hardware, signal processing algorithms, and experimental evaluation.
